# Cluster analysis in customer segmentation

When analyzing a large amount of data, the problem that the data on the objects of observation are not connected and structured, but are only "thrown" into the database, often arises. The most commonly used mathematical-statistical method for classifying objects into groups of similar characteristics is cluster analysis.

This project focuses on cluster analysis through application in market segmentation. The database is taken from the Kaggle  site and contains data on supermarket customers, obtained on the basis of their membership cards. It consists of 200 observations, i.e. customers, with 5 variables: CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income ($ 000) and Spending Score (1-100), i.e. the value assigned to the customer based on data on purchasing behavior.
